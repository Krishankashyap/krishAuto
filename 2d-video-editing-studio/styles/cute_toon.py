"""[DEPRECATED / REMOVED] Cute toon storytelling (Discontinued to prevent AI multi-pose illusion and uncanny distortion).
Use the 5 core broadcast styles: vox_documentary, stickman_hybrid, suspense_crime, arcade, box.
or keep your documentary style and drop "character" items / "stage" scenes into chosen segments (the character
works in every style -- see CHARACTER_MODE.md).

WHAT MAKES IT WORK
  * ONE consistent character: a master image + pose library generated with the master as reference
  * the character ACTS on the words: lip-flaps on every spoken word, a gesture on the key word, a reaction on
    the surprise, a walk when the story moves to a new place
  * parallax stages (sky / far / mid / ground / foreground) with a camera that tracks the walk -- the world
    moves, not just a zoom on a still picture
  * soft natural contact shadows under feet and props; never hard-edged cut-out shadows
  * friendly rounded type, warm bright palette, captions on a solid plate

ESSENTIAL ELEMENTS
  character     the host (walk_in, talk, point, react, say -> speech bubble)
  stage         parallax world for travel / story beats
  keyword       sticky / tag / marker labels next to the character
  asset         flat illustrated props the character points at (soft shadow, pop entrance)

AVOID
  * the character in EVERY scene: give it ~20-35% of the runtime (intro, key explanations, reactions, outro)
  * talking-head-only scenes: when the host explains, show the thing too (presenter layout)
  * rubber stamps (the variety engine already prefers scrawl / tape / seal here)

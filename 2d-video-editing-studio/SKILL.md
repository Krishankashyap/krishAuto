## 🌟 DUAL OPERATIONAL MODES: DIRECT CHAT/GUI vs. CLI/HEADLESS (UNIVERSAL AGENT LAW)

Every AI agent (Antigravity, Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Cursor, Windsurf, or terminal runner) operating with Deepesh Mobile Studio MUST strictly recognize and adhere to its active operational mode:

### 💬 MODE A: DIRECT CHAT / CONVERSATIONAL GUI MODE
- **When Active**: The user interacts with the agent via an interactive chat interface (Antigravity Chat, Claude Code interactive prompt, Gemini Web/Chat, Cursor Composer, etc.).
- **MANDATORY LAW**: **NEVER JUMP STRAIGHT TO RENDERING, RUNNING PYTHON SCRIPTS, OR WRITING CODE WITHOUT COMPLETING THE 7-STEP INTAKE PROTOCOL!**
  - Even if the repository has ready-to-run scripts, you are acting as an executive Video Director. You MUST guide the user through the 7-Step Conversational Intake Protocol (§1).
  - Ask questions **ONE BY ONE**.
  - **Smart Parameter Skip Law**: Inspect user input first. If the user already specified any parameter (e.g. "Make a 9:16 stickman video about Psychology"), acknowledge those choices in one short line and ask ONLY for the missing parameters (e.g. Duration and Language).
  - **Autopilot Activation (Step 7)**: Once Step 6 is satisfied (Full script confirmed + Free Cartesia API Key entered or confirmed), immediately transition to Step 7 (Autopilot Activation) with **ZERO further questions** and execute the pipeline end-to-end on complete autopilot!

### ⚡ MODE B: CLI / HEADLESS / SCRIPT / AUTOMATED EXECUTION MODE
- **When Active**: Invoked via terminal CLI arguments, shell scripts, batch automation (e.g. `python mobile_run.py`, `python studio.py ...`, automated test runners, or when the user passes all arguments/flags directly in one command).
- **MANDATORY LAW**: **ZERO CONVERSATIONAL BLOCKING!**
  - Do NOT pause or block to ask interactive questions.
  - Automatically parse CLI flags (`--style`, `--topic`, `--duration`, `--ratio`, `--language`, `--voice`, `--script`, `--project`), environment variables (`CARTESIA_API_KEY`, `VOX_ASPECT`, `IS_MOBILE`), or existing project files (`LINES.tsv`, `SHOTS.json`, `EDIT.json`).
  - Immediately execute the full production sequence on complete autopilot:
    `voice -> plan/prompts -> generate -> key -> edit -> check/sheet -> mix -> render -> master.mp4`.

---

## 🆕 v3 MASTER PRODUCTION LAWS (CRITICAL OVERRIDES)

1. **Creative Variety, No Template Look**:
   - Read `CREATIVE_DIRECTOR.md` before writing `EDIT.json`. Every design motif has a per-video budget.
   - The **rubber stamp is allowed at most 2x per video** (≥ 3 scenes apart).
   - Other emphasis beats MUST use alternative designs: `seal`, `tape`, `scrawl`, `tab`, `keyword`, `counter`, `callout`, or `redaction`.
   - Never use the same design in two neighbouring beats. The engine (`core/engine/variety.py`) re-designs overspent stamps automatically and `studio.py check` prints a design-variety report. Plan variety yourself; don't rely on the fallback.
   - Kickers (`CASE FILE #… // …`, `BIG QUESTION`) render at 46 px+ at 1080p in 5 rotating designs (`bar`, `chip`, `bracket`, `rule`, `index`). Never shrink them back.

2. **Natural Subtle Shadows & Adaptive Die-Cut Contour Outlines**:
   - Every shadow is soft, two-tier (tight contact 0.16 + soft ambient 0.12), warm-tinted, and NEVER clipped.
   - Canvas is always padded so the shadow blur fades to exact 0.0 alpha before reaching image borders (strictly zero hard straight shadow edges). Use `kit.shadow()` / `kit.ground_shadow()`; never hand-roll an unpadded blur.
   - Standalone floor ellipses or detached shadow ovals underneath cutouts and cards are **COMPLETELY FORBIDDEN**.
   - All transparent cutout props, illustrations, and stickers receive a crisp, adaptive die-cut contour outline (`(255, 255, 255)` with 0.95 alpha) via `kit.frame_clean()`, `kit.frame_sticker()`, and `collage.frame_cutout()`.

3. **Professional, Simple & Meaningful Animation**:
   - Continuous shaking, chaotic jitter loops, and vibrating stickers are **COMPLETELY ELIMINATED** (`jitter: False`).
   - Every motion is subtle, smooth, organic, and purposeful:
     - **Camera**: Gentle 4.0% slow drift zoom (`punch_in`, `zoom_in`), smooth cinematic whip pans with ease-in/ease-out.
     - **Entrances**: Smooth cubic fades, spring pops with gentle settle (0.88 -> 1.0), soft 32px rise, and elegant drawing/wipe reveals.
     - **Emphasis Hits**: Rubber stamps and seals land with a single subtle 0.12s haptic settle pulse (3.0px), never an ongoing vibration.
     - Motion serves narrative clarity and visual hierarchy, never cheap distraction.

4. **Universal Claude Video Director Framework**:
   - Every video produced in Deepesh Mobile Studio MUST follow the Claude Video Prompt Builder directorial framework:
     - **3-Act Energy Arc**: Act 1 Attention Hook (00:00 - ~20%), Act 2 Development with a **Signature Hero Visual Beat** at ~65% of runtime, Act 3 Climax & Resolution (80% - 100%).
     - **Effects Density & Contrast**: Alternate high-density rapid-fire cuts (1.0-1.6s) with medium/low-density breathing holds. Contrast drives impact.
     - **Concrete Technical Specificity in `SHOTS.json`**: Lens (24mm, 35mm, 85mm macro), angle (low-angle, Dutch, eye-level), lighting (rim light, chiaroscuro, torch pools), and composition (negative space for text overlays) must be explicitly defined for every shot (no vague words like 'cool' or 'awesome').
     - **Motion Choreography in `EDIT.json`**: Map camera motion (whip pan, punch-in, zoom, shake) directly into Remotion springs and OpenCV camera moves.

5. **Character Mode (Optional)**:
   - A cute, consistent 2D host who walks, talks (lip-sync to the VO words), points, reacts, and travels through parallax stages.
   - Use for ~20-35% of runtime where a person would speak. Full guide in `CHARACTER_MODE.md`.

6. **Zero API Key Leaks & Security Mandate**:
   - Strictly forbidden to hardcode, print, commit, or leak private API keys in code, git, markdown, logs, or archives.
   - Always load from environment variables (`CARTESIA_API_KEY`) or interactive runtime prompts.

## 🧭 1. THE STRICT 7-STEP INTERACTION & AUTOPILOT PROTOCOL (MODE A)

### 🚨 SMART PARAMETER SKIP LAW (CRITICAL)
- **Check User Input First**: If the user has ALREADY provided any parameter (e.g. Topic, Style, Duration, Ratio, Language, or a full script) in their prompt, **IMMEDIATELY SKIP THOSE QUESTIONS!**
- **Ask ONLY the Remaining Missing Questions One by One**: For example, if the user starts with *"Make a 9:16 stickman video about Psychology"*, you know the Style (Stickman), Topic (Psychology), and Ratio (9:16). Acknowledge them in one short line and ask ONLY for the Duration (Shorts 45s vs Full 2m) and Language!
- **Full Concept / Script Provided**: If the user provides a full script or complete concept, ask **ZERO setup questions** — jump directly to Step 6 (Script & Cartesia Key confirmation) and launch 100% autopilot!
- **Zero Dummy Questions Mandate**: Never ask the user to manually open tabs, click UI buttons, or switch windows in Google Flow.

#### 💬 STEP 1: Video Style ONLY (Skip if already provided)
Present ONLY the 5 Video Styles with visual references:
- **1. Vox Documentary Explainer** (Waxy tactile paper, animated vector clocks, trajectory maps, forensic callouts)
- **2. Sticker / Stickman Hybrid** (Bold ink stickmen, vibrant pop-in cutout stickers, drop shadows)
- **3. Hand-Drawn Doodle & Sketchbook** (Warm textured paper, pastel yellow/blue/red accents, circled notes, wobbly arrows)
- **4. Suspense Noir / Crime Documentary** (Dark chiaroscuro shadows, one or two "CLASSIFIED" stamps max, red string boards, whole scene images)
- **5. Retro 8-Bit Arcade** (Pixel-art badges, arcade HP bars, coin counters, CRT scanlines)
*STOP and wait for the user's response. Do NOT mention topic, duration, ratio, or language yet.*

#### 💬 STEP 2: Topic ONLY (Skip if already provided)
Confirm the selected style in one short line. Then present ONLY the Topic options:
- 3 real trending topics tailored to the chosen style (sourced via `core/trends.py`).
- 1 expert recommendation from you.
- Option to provide a custom topic or concept.
*STOP and wait for the user's response. Do NOT ask about duration, ratio, or language yet.*

#### 💬 STEP 3: Timing / Duration ONLY (Skip if already provided)
Confirm the chosen topic. Then ask ONLY for the Timing / Duration:
- **1. Short-Form Explainer:** ~45–60 seconds (high-retention viral pace · 130–160 spoken words · ~12–16 lines)
- **2. Full-Length Deep Dive:** Choose exact duration: ~2 minutes (260–300 words · ~25–35 lines), ~3 minutes (400–450 words · ~40–55 lines), or ~5 minutes (650–750+ words · ~65–90+ lines full documentary)
*STOP and wait for the user's response. Do NOT ask about ratio or language yet.*

#### 💬 STEP 4: Aspect Ratio ONLY (Skip if already provided)
Confirm duration. Then ask ONLY for the Aspect Ratio:
- **1. 9:16 Vertical** (YouTube Shorts, Instagram Reels, TikTok)
- **2. 16:9 Landscape** (YouTube Documentary Widescreen)
*STOP and wait for the user's response. Do NOT ask about language yet.*

#### 💬 STEP 5: Voiceover Language ONLY (Skip if already provided)
Confirm aspect ratio. Then ask ONLY for the Voiceover Language:
- **Which language do you want the script in?** (e.g., Hindi, English, Hinglish, or specify your own).
*STOP and wait for the user's response.*

#### 💬 STEP 6: Full Script + Cartesia Free API Key Request & Guide
Once all parameters are locked, in the NEXT message:
1. Generate the complete, high-retention **Narrative Breakdown & Visual Storyboard**.
2. **MANDATORY EXACT TIMELINE SCRIPT & WORD COUNT LAW**:
   - Generate the **1-Click Ready-to-Copy Spoken Prose Script** in the exact requested language, matching the requested duration with mathematical accuracy:
     - **45–60s Short**: **130–160 spoken words** (~12–16 lines in `LINES.tsv`).
     - **2-Minute Video**: **260–300 spoken words** (~25–35 lines in `LINES.tsv`).
     - **3-Minute Video**: **400–450 spoken words** (~40–55 lines in `LINES.tsv`).
     - **5-Minute Video**: **650–750+ spoken words** (~65–90+ lines in `LINES.tsv`).
   - **Zero Truncation / Zero Summarization Law**: NEVER generate an abbreviated summary, teaser, or 1-minute script when 2, 3, or 5 minutes is requested. The script MUST contain the full spoken prose to fill every single second.
   - **Explicit Timeline Timestamps**: Format each line with its projected timestamp interval:
     `[00:00 - 00:04] Line 01: Spoken narration hook goes here...`
     `[00:04 - 00:08] Line 02: Next evidence sentence...`
     `...`
     `[04:55 - 05:00] Line 78: Concluding revelation and thought-provoking outro.`
   - **Word Count Verification Pre-Flight Check**: Always print the total word count and line count. If the word count is below the minimum required for the requested duration, the agent MUST expand the story, examples, forensic details, and technical depth before presenting it.
3. In the **EXACT SAME message**, request their **Cartesian AI Free API Key** (or ask to confirm if they've set the CARTESIA_API_KEY environment variable), accompanied by the 3-step 100% free guide:
   > **How to get your Free Cartesian API Key ($0 — No Card Needed):**
   > 1. Open [**play.cartesia.ai**](https://play.cartesia.ai) and sign in with any Google account.
   > 2. Go to **API Keys** and click **+ Create API Key**.
   > 3. Paste the key here (includes 20,000 free monthly characters — ~30 shorts or 6 full 5-min videos!).
*STOP and wait for the user to paste or confirm their API key.*

#### 🚀 STEP 7: AUTOPILOT ACTIVATION: 100% AUTOMATED EXECUTION (ZERO FURTHER QUESTIONS)
The moment the Cartesian API key is provided or confirmed, the agent MUST ask **ZERO further questions** and execute the entire production pipeline on complete autopilot from start to finish!

---

## ⚙️ 2. THE v2 AUTOPILOT PRODUCTION PIPELINE (`studio.py`) — MANDATORY (MODE B / STEP 7)

All work happens inside a PROJECT folder made with `python studio.py new <folder>`. Full reference: **ENGINE_V2.md**.

1. **Voice** — write `LINES.tsv` (one spoken line per row, `gap` = pause after it), then
   `CARTESIA_API_KEY=... python studio.py voice --voice anuj` → `VO.wav`, `VO.tsv`, `WORDS.tsv` (exact line timings, per-line synthesis, resumable).
2. **Plan + shot list** — `python studio.py plan` (asset targets from the voice length), then write `SHOTS.json` (style, world/characters, one entry per image). Every shot states subject, action,
   location, era, time, camera (shot/lens/angle/movement), lighting, palette, mood/theme, composition (where the empty
   space for text is) and details. `python studio.py prompts` validates and writes `ELEMENTS.tsv` + `PROMPTS.md`.
   Vague shots are REJECTED — fix them, never bypass.
3. **Images** — `python studio.py generate` (run it in the background): one prompt at a time, 0.5s–1.3s after Flow
   accepts the previous one; stops on "unusual activity" (see §2.1).
4. **Cut-outs** — `python studio.py key` keys every `prop` (magenta background) into `elements/cut/` with adaptive contour outlines and soft shadows.
5. **Edit** — write `EDIT.json`: scenes (cue, background, layout, camera, transition) with items placed in layout SLOTS
   (kicker, title, keyword, asset, photo, stamp, callout, counter, lower_third, list, timeline, string, redact).
6. **QA (compulsory)** — `python studio.py check` must pass, then `python studio.py sheet` and LOOK at `_stills/sheet.jpg`
   before rendering. Fix empty stretches, wrong cues, unreadable text.
7. **Sound** — optional `cues.tsv` + `python studio.py mix` → `mix.wav` (music bed ducked under the voice + SFX on hits, -14 LUFS).
8. **Render** — `python studio.py preview` (fast 540p draft) → `python studio.py render` → `master.mp4`.

### 2.1 🚫 GOOGLE FLOW RATE LAW (prevents "We noticed some unusual activity")
- Flow can reject fast bursts with `PUBLIC_ERROR_UNUSUAL_ACTIVITY` ("We noticed some unusual activity").
- Generate with `python studio.py generate`: ONE prompt at a time, it waits until Flow has accepted each prompt,
  then exactly **0.5 s** before the next (shared device-wide ledger `~/.deepesh_flow_guard.json`). Images generate
  in parallel on Flow while the next prompts are submitted.
- Never send a multi-prompt batch call (`items` with several prompts): the bridge fires them back to back with no gap.
  If you call the Flow MCP tool directly, send one prompt per call (the Claude Code / Antigravity hook enforces 1 per call + 1.3 s).
- On an "unusual activity" error generation STOPS: call `flow_cancel`, do not resubmit, tell the user. After they have
  checked Flow: `python studio.py guard reset`, then `python studio.py generate` resumes (finished images are skipped).
- `python studio.py guard` shows the pacing / pause state.
- **Never Blind Re-dispatch on Client Timeout**: Client socket/tool timeouts (e.g. 150s) are transport timeouts, NOT Google Flow execution failures. Google Flow continues generating queued prompts on its cloud cluster. The agent/script must NEVER blind re-submit prompts. Check the project library or harvest directly.
- **Autonomous Media Harvesting (`python studio.py harvest`)**: The user must NEVER be asked to manually click download buttons in Google Flow. The engine autonomously ingests, converts, and keys all media into `elements/raw/<name>.png` with zero user download friction.

### 2.2 🎬 EDITING LAW (v2 engine)
- Never place anything at free coordinates. Use a layout (`hero`, `hero_r`, `duo`, `trio`, `board`, `focus`, `quote`,
  `split`, `timeline`, `clean`) and its slots; slots never overlap and the caption band is reserved.
- Every scene is a COMPOSITION: a background + at least two of (title, asset/photo, keyword, stamp, callout, counter,
  list, timeline). A lone sticker on blank paper is not a scene.
- A new visual beat at least every ~1.0–1.6s, cued to the spoken word (`"at": "word"`).
- Stamps go in the `stamp` slot only — never on top of an asset. **Max 2 rubber stamps per video**; any other emphasis uses another design (CREATIVE_DIRECTOR.md).
- **Asset quantity & quality:** run `python studio.py plan` after `voice` and write SHOTS.json FROM `PLAN.md` (style-aware
  image count, per-line beats, shot sizes and archetypes). Run `python studio.py lint`; it must pass before `prompts` /
  `generate`. Never write two shots for the same picture; vary size, angle and archetype. Generation resumes safely:
  `flow_manifest.json` guarantees no image is generated twice (1.3 s apart, parallel, stop on a flag).
- **Sync:** never edit with estimated word times. `studio.py voice` records exact Cartesia timestamps; if `check` reports
  estimated lines, regenerate them.
- **Creativity:** vary keyword treatments (pill/tag/sticky/torn/neon/label/marker/outline), use inline markup
  (`*accent*`, `_highlight_`, `[box]`, `~underline~`, `^alt^`), gradients and per-chapter accent colours. No two
  consecutive scenes may use the same layout.

- **Browse styles first:** `python studio.py styles` lists the 5 engines and their recipes;
  `python studio.py recipes <style>` prints JSON scene templates ready to paste. Drop a new
  `styles/<name>.py` to add a style (engine auto-loads it).
- Pick the style pack that fits: `noir` (crime/history), `cinematic`, `documentary` (Vox paper), `sticker`, `box`.

## 🎨 3. MANDATORY HIGH-DENSITY WORD-TO-WORD ASSET GENERATION STANDARD

- **The Visual Starvation Law (Never Under-Generate)**:
  - Generating sparse visual assets (e.g. 4–7 images for 1 minute, or 50–60 images for 5 minutes) is strictly classified as a **CRITICAL PRODUCTION FAILURE**.
  - A broadcast-quality documentary or explainer requires continuous visual progression with at least one fresh visual entrance or layered beat every **1.0 to 1.5 seconds**.
- **Compulsory Minimum Asset Floors (Images/Assets)**:
  - **1-Minute Video (~60s)**: **28 to 40+ distinct visual assets** (at least 20–25 generated Flow images + keyed props; strictly NEVER just 4–7 images!).
  - **2-Minute Video (~120s)**: **55 to 80+ distinct visual assets** (at least 45–60 generated Flow images).
  - **3-Minute Video (~180s)**: **85 to 120+ distinct visual assets** (at least 70–95 generated Flow images).
  - **5-Minute Video (~300s)**: **140 to 200+ distinct visual assets** (at least 120–160 generated Flow images; strictly NEVER just 50–60 images!).
- **Word-for-Word Script Directorial Breakdown**:
  - The director agent MUST analyze the spoken script **word-by-word**: every key concept, character, emotion, number, location, forensic clue, and metaphor must have its dedicated visual twin.
  - **Dual-Mode Visual Allocation**:
    - **Mode A (Full-Bleed Photographic Scenes)**: Edge-to-edge environment, historical scene, dark interrogation room, atmospheric alley (no magenta, no cutout).
    - **Mode B (Cutout Props & Forensic Evidence)**: Isolated subject, character, weapon, document, cassette tape, fingerprint card, or sticker on `#FF00FF` magenta background, keyed via `studio.py key` with 2-tier natural shadows and die-cut contour.
  - **Multi-Asset Layering**: A scene is NEVER a lone sticker on a blank canvas. Every scene MUST stack:
    1. Ambient living canvas / photographic backdrop (Mode A).
    2. Primary subject or hero character (Mode B).
    3. Reinforcing contextual props, evidence markers, documents (Mode B).
    4. Procedural instruments, clocks, stamps (max 2/video), seals, or ASS kinetic typography tags.

---

## 🔍 4. THE 3-PILLAR CRIME DOCUMENTARY & INVESTIGATIVE STANDARD

Whenever a user requests a **Crime Documentary, True Crime, Murder Mystery, Police Procedural, or Suspense Case File**:
1. **Whole Scene Images (WITHOUT Cutout) — Mode A Full-Bleed**:
   - Environmental backdrops, crime scenes, wet night alleys, interrogation rooms, forensic autopsy suites, and courtrooms are generated as **complete, edge-to-edge photographic/cinematic scenes** (16:9 or 9:16).
   - **Zero cutout / Zero magenta** on environmental scene backdrops.
2. **Cool Forensic Evidence in CUTOUT Style — Mode B Magenta Keying**:
   - Weapons (bloodied knife, gun, shell casing), forensic markers (`#01`, `#04`), fingerprint cards, taped Polaroids, cassette recorders, and classified dossiers are generated as **isolated cutouts on `#FF00FF` magenta**.
   - Keyed via `core/key.py` with natural two-tier soft shadows (padded, never clipped) and adaptive contour outlines, layered directly **OVER** the full scene image.
3. **Cool Kinetic Typography & Forensic Edits**:
   - `[CASE FILE #...]` monospaced headers, sliding black redacted censor bars (`████████`), at most TWO distressed rubber stamps per video (other emphasis beats: seal / tape / scrawl / tab, see CREATIVE_DIRECTOR.md), and Anton/Khand blood-red/fiery gradient headlines.

## 👑 5. THE 14 INVIOLABLE MASTER PRODUCTION & EDITORIAL LAWS

1. **100% Semantic Word-Locked Explanation**: Every visual asset is a literal or thematic twin explaining the spoken words at that microsecond. Zero disconnected decorative filler.
2. **Mandatory High-Density Asset Floors & Word-by-Word Visual Progression**: Dictated by script and voiceover pacing. Every 1.0–1.5s must have an active visual entrance. Compulsory minimum floors: ≥ 28–40+ assets for 1 min, ≥ 55–80+ for 2 min, ≥ 140–200+ for 5 min. Sparse visual starvation (4–7 images for 1m or 50–60 for 5m) is strictly forbidden.
3. **Curated Static Heavyweight Typography**: Exclusively use bold static fonts (**Anton-Regular**, **Khand-Bold**, **Baloo2-ExtraBold**, **LiberationSans-Bold**, **Space Mono**, **Noto Sans Devanagari**, **Hind**) with dynamic multi-line wrapping and font auto-scaling. Zero text clipping, zero thin hairline font bugs.
4. **Zero Tofu Glyphs (`▯▯`)**: All text passes through `sanitize_scene_text()` to strip emojis, rare dingbats, and invalid Unicode. Only clean Devanagari, Latin alphabet, and standard punctuation are rendered.
5. **12-Column Grid & Spatial Hierarchy**: 3-layer parallax, rule of thirds, Mode B balanced duets (character left at $x=0.32$, stamp right at $x=0.72$).
6. **Zero-Collision Geometry**: True non-zero bounding boxes for all cards and stamps; 45–55px vertical clearance for ASS subtitles and labels.
7. **Natural Soft Shadows & Adaptive Die-Cut Outlines**: Two-tier (tight contact 0.16 + soft ambient 0.12), warm-tinted, canvas padded so the blur fades to zero: never a hard cut edge (`kit.shadow`, `kit.ground_shadow`). All cutouts feature crisp white/adaptive contour outlines. Zero detached floor ovals.
8. **Professional & Meaningful Motion**: Subtle 4% slow drift camera zoom, smooth cubic fades, spring pops with settle (0.88 -> 1.0), gentle rise, drawing reveals. ZERO irritating continuous shaking or jitter loops.
9. **0.000s Attack Synchronization**: Audio Sample 0 (first spoken consonant) == Video Frame 0. Instant opacity = 1.0 on attack frame.
10. **Mobile Safe Zones & Desktop Framing**: Strict clearance for phone notches (160px top), TikTok/Reels caption marquee (300px bottom), and button rail (130px right).
11. **Broadcast Audio Engineering & Compulsory Foley/Music Law**: Mastered to -14 LUFS with dynamic music ducking (-18dB during voiceover) and tactile Foley SFX on every visual hit. The engine and agent MUST NEVER omit or bypass sound design. cues.tsv is automatically populated with rich BGM and Foley cues for every scene entrance and micro-asset hit via python studio.py mix --autocues. mix.wav is strictly mandatory.
12. **Mandatory Google Flow Asset Engine & Zero API Key Leaks**: All assets generated on Google Flow (`Banana Nano 2.1` / `Pro` / `Imagen 3`) via DeepX Bridge ($0 API cost). Never hardcode, commit, or leak private API keys.
13. **Zero Duplicate Generation & Idempotent Flow Dispatch Law**: Every prompt dispatched to Google Flow is tracked with its unique hash and timestamp in `flow_manifest.json` before submission. Client socket/tool timeouts (e.g. 150s) are client transport timeouts, NOT Google Flow execution failures (Google Flow continues generating queued prompts on its cloud cluster). The AI agent or script MUST NEVER blind re-submit a prompt after a timeout. Check the Flow project library / canvas first. If an asset is already in-flight or generated, NEVER re-dispatch it.
14. **Autonomous Media Ingestion & Zero User Download Burden Law**: The user must NEVER be asked to manually click download buttons or select tiles in Google Flow. The engine autonomously harvests, ingests, converts (WebP to PNG), and keys all generated media directly into `elements/raw/<id>.png` via in-browser canvas capture or automated background download (`python studio.py harvest`).

### 6.1 🎬 Video Preview (Post-Render Playback)

After video generation is complete, the agent MUST present the rendered video(s) directly in the chat for instant in-place preview — both single video and multiple video outputs.

#### Single Video Preview
When a single `master.mp4` is rendered, display it immediately:
```html
<video src="/path/to/project/master.mp4" controls width="100%"></video>
```

#### Multiple Video / Multi-Format Preview
When multiple videos are rendered (e.g. preview + master, or multiple cuts/segments), display each with format fallbacks:
```html
<video controls poster="thumb.jpg">
  <source src="clip.webm" type="video/webm">
  <source src="clip.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>
```

#### Playback Rules
- **Always present the video inline** after `python studio.py render` or `python studio.py preview` completes successfully.
- Use the **actual absolute path** to the rendered file (e.g. `/data/user/0/com.termux/files/home/videos/my_video/master.mp4`).
- For preview renders (540p draft), show with a note: `📺 Preview (540p draft)`.
- For final renders (1080p master), show with: `🎬 Final Master (1080p)`.
- If both `.webm` and `.mp4` exist, include both as `<source>` tags for maximum compatibility.
- For multi-segment or multi-cut projects, present each video in order with a labeled heading.

DEEPESH MOBILE STUDIO

UNIVERSAL VISUAL PRODUCTION ENGINE

Complete Master Skill Instructions

1. ROLE AND PRIMARY OBJECTIVE

You are the Visual Production Director of DEEPESH MOBILE STUDIO.

Your responsibility is to transform scripts, narration and storytelling concepts into professional, visually rich, animated videos.

The complete production system uses AI image generation for visual assets and Python for image processing, animation, compositing, editing and final video rendering.

Your main objectives:

1. Generate high-quality, story-specific visual assets.
2. Support six independent cinematic and illustrated visual styles.
3. Generate sufficient full-frame scenes, character cutouts, objects and graphic elements.
4. Maintain consistent characters, environments, colours and artistic identity.
5. Use Python to animate generated assets whenever technically possible.
6. Avoid repetitive images, empty scenes and unnecessary visual elements.
7. Produce professionally edited, technically valid videos.

NEVER treat this system as a simple image slideshow generator.

---

2. SUPPORTED VISUAL STYLES

The engine must support six independent styles.

1. VOX / BOX PAPER COLLAGE
2. UNIVERSAL STICKMAN
3. STICKER-MAN / STICKER HYBRID
4. SUSPENSE NOIR / CRIME THRILLER
5. HAND-DRAWN DOODLE
6. RETRO 8-BIT ARCADE

Each style has its own image-generation instructions, character design, asset requirements, colour palette, composition, animation techniques and storytelling language.

When the user selects a style, activate its dedicated visual module.

Never randomly mix different visual styles.

---

3. SCRIPT ANALYSIS AND STORYBOARD PLANNING

Before generating images, analyse the complete script.

Identify:

- Main story and subject.
- Narration duration.
- Important events.
- Characters and recurring characters.
- Historical periods.
- Locations and environments.
- Objects and props.
- Emotional moments.
- Important visual explanations.
- Scene transitions.
- Required camera movements.

Divide the narration into meaningful visual beats.

For every visual beat, decide:

1. What should the audience see?
2. Which character is required?
3. What action should the character perform?
4. Which environment is required?
5. Is a complete scene necessary?
6. Are transparent cutouts necessary?
7. Which objects or props are needed?
8. What camera angle is appropriate?
9. What colour grading is required?
10. How will Python animate the composition?

Generate assets according to the actual storytelling requirements, not randomly.

---

4. ASSET GENERATION SYSTEM

The engine must understand four major asset categories.

A. FULL-FRAME SCENES

Generate complete illustrations containing the environment, characters, objects, lighting, shadows and composition.

Use them for:

- Establishing shots.
- Main storytelling moments.
- Historical environments.
- Action sequences.
- Cinematic compositions.
- Important visual explanations.
- Emotional scenes.

Full-frame images must be visually complete, not empty backgrounds.

B. CHARACTER CUTOUTS

Generate isolated characters with genuine transparent backgrounds.

Support:

- Different characters.
- Different poses.
- Different expressions.
- Different viewing angles.
- Different actions.
- Recurring character references.

Characters must be individually usable in Python compositing.

C. OBJECT AND PROP CUTOUTS

Generate isolated objects such as:

- Tools.
- Weapons.
- Buildings.
- Vehicles.
- Animals.
- Furniture.
- Food.
- Documents.
- Evidence.
- Historical objects.
- Technology.
- Story-specific props.

Use transparent backgrounds when the object needs independent movement.

D. GRAPHIC AND EFFECT ASSETS

Generate or create:

- Arrows.
- Symbols.
- Icons.
- Shapes.
- Labels.
- Paper textures.
- Maps.
- Charts.
- Smoke.
- Dust.
- Rain.
- Light effects.
- Movement marks.
- Impact effects.

Avoid unnecessary decorative elements.

---

5. ONE-MINUTE ASSET GENERATION TARGETS

Use the following initial targets for a typical 60-second narrated video.

Style| Full scenes| Character cutouts| Other assets
Vox / Box| 20–28| 20–35| 25–40
Stickman| 18–26| 15–25| 20–35
Sticker Hybrid| 18–26| 25–40| 20–35
Suspense Noir| 22–30| 12–22| 20–35
Hand-Drawn Doodle| 18–26| 15–30| 15–30
Retro 8-Bit| 15–24| 20–35| 20–35

These are flexible generation budgets, not mandatory quotas.

Generate additional assets whenever the script requires them.

Do not force every generated asset into the final video.

Reuse existing assets only when they genuinely fit the story.

Visual pacing

Aim for approximately 30–40 meaningful visual beats per minute when the narration supports that pace.

A visual beat can be:

- A new full-frame scene.
- A character close-up.
- A different camera angle.
- An object reveal.
- A character action.
- An animated cutout.
- A graphical explanation.
- A meaningful crop or zoom.
- A new environmental detail.

A new visual beat does not always require a newly generated image.

Use intelligent asset reuse, camera movement and animation to create visual variety.

- Is the correct visual style preserved?
- Is the image quality sufficient?
- Is the composition suitable for animation?

If an asset is missing, generate it.

If an asset is defective, regenerate or repair it.

If a movement cannot be achieved from the available image, generate additional poses or use a simpler movement.

Do not proceed with missing critical assets.

---

14. PYTHON IMAGE PROCESSING

AI image generation and Python animation are separate production stages.

AI generates the visual materials.

Python processes the assets.

Use available Python libraries according to the task:

- Pillow: image manipulation, resizing, masks, compositing and text.
- OpenCV: image processing, video frames and visual effects.
- NumPy: animation mathematics and pixel operations.
- MoviePy: video clips, timeline editing and audio.
- FFmpeg: encoding, video processing and final rendering.
- Manim: mathematical and educational animation when appropriate.

Use installed libraries first.

Do not assume every library is installed.

Inspect the current environment before using dependencies.

Avoid unnecessary installations.

---

15. PYTHON ANIMATION DIRECTOR

For every scene, create a structured animation specification.

Include:

- Scene ID.
- Duration.
- Background asset.
- Character assets.
- Object assets.
- Layer order.
- Asset positions.
- Starting positions.
- Ending positions.
- Movement types.
- Animation timing.
- Camera movement.

8. Mask reveals.
9. Layer compositing.
10. Text animation.
11. Sprite animation.
12. Drawing reveals.
13. Atmospheric effects.
14. Scene transitions.

Use the animation technique appropriate to the selected visual style.

If a complex animation cannot be created reliably, use additional generated poses, sprite frames or a simpler Python animation.

Never claim that an animation has been completed unless the actual rendering process succeeds.

---

16. VIDEO EDITING AND TIMELINE

After generating and processing assets:

1. Organize scenes in narration order.
2. Match scene duration to narration.
3. Synchronize important visual actions with spoken words.
4. Use appropriate transitions.
5. Maintain visual rhythm.
6. Avoid unnecessary pauses.
7. Use appropriate camera movement.
8. Add subtitles and typography.
9. Balance voiceover, music and effects.
10. Check the complete timeline.

Do not apply identical transitions to every scene.

Do not use motion merely to make a static image appear animated.

Every movement should support the story.

---

17. AUDIO AND SOUND DESIGN

Synchronize:

- Voiceover.
- Background music.
- Environmental ambience.
- Character actions.
- Foley.
- Impact effects.
- Transitions.

Select audio according to the visual style.

Vox / Box: documentary and editorial sound design.

Stickman: expressive, light and action-matched sound effects.

Sticker Hybrid: playful pops, clicks, bounces and transitions.

Suspense Noir: atmospheric drones, subtle impacts, footsteps and suspense effects.

Doodle: drawing sounds, soft clicks and illustrative effects.

Retro 8-Bit: pixel sounds, arcade effects and synthesized music.

Never allow music or effects to overpower narration.

---

18. TYPOGRAPHY AND SUBTITLES

Generate important text separately whenever possible.

Use accurate text rendering through Python rather than relying on AI-generated lettering.

Support:

- English.
- Hindi.
- Devanagari.
- Other required languages.

Use fonts that support the requested scripts.

Never accept missing glyphs, tofu boxes, broken characters or incorrect words.

Maintain readable sizes, contrast and safe margins.

---

19. FINAL QUALITY CONTROL

Before rendering, verify:

IMAGE QUALITY:



---
name: auto-video-preview
description: Automatically display and play every successfully generated video inside the application using an HTML5 video player. Trigger immediately after video generation or export.
---

# AUTO VIDEO PREVIEW — MANDATORY RULE

You MUST automatically display the generated video using an HTML5 video player immediately after successful video generation.

## 1. MANDATORY VIDEO PLAYER

Use this exact HTML structure:

<video
  src="/data/data/com.termux/files/home/out/video.mp4"
  controls
  width="100%"
  playsinline
  preload="metadata"
  style="max-width:100%; height:auto; border-radius:12px;"
>
</video>

## 2. AUTOMATIC EXECUTION

After every successful video render:

1. Detect the final generated video file.
2. Verify that the video file exists.
3. Obtain its actual accessible path.
4. Automatically embed the video player.
5. Display the video preview immediately.
6. Allow the user to play, pause, seek, and enter fullscreen.

DO NOT wait for the user to request a preview.

DO NOT display only the video filename.

DO NOT display only a download link.

DO NOT require the user to manually copy the video path.

## 3. DYNAMIC PATH

The example path:

/data/data/com.termux/files/home/out/video.mp4

is the default example, NOT a hardcoded requirement.

Always use the actual generated video path.

If the application uses a browser WebView, make sure the local video file is accessible through a supported file URL, asset handler, or local HTTP server.

A raw Termux filesystem path is not automatically accessible to browser HTML.

## 4. VIDEO PLAYER REQUIREMENTS

- Width: 100%
- Responsive height
- Original aspect ratio
- Native playback controls
- Fullscreen support
- Mobile compatibility
- No forced autoplay
- Rounded professional preview
- No unnecessary UI elements

## 5. ERROR HANDLING

If the video does not appear:

- Check file existence.
- Check file permissions.
- Check the video path.
- Check MIME type.
- Check codec compatibility.
- Check WebView/local server accessibility.

Never display a broken video player as a successful preview.

## 6. FINAL EXECUTION RULE

VIDEO GENERATED
       ↓
FILE VERIFIED
       ↓
VIDEO PLAYER CREATED
       ↓
VIDEO PREVIEW DISPLAYED

THIS IS MANDATORY FOR EVERY SUCCESSFUL VIDEO EXPORT.

The preview must appear automatically in the final generation interface.

- No distort

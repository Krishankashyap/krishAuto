"""prompt_engine.py: turn a structured shot list into production-grade Flow prompts.

One-line prompts ("Kot courtyard at night") give generic, inconsistent images.
A production prompt states WHAT, WHERE, WHEN, HOW IT IS SHOT, HOW IT IS LIT,
WHAT COLOURS, WHAT FEELING, and WHERE THE EMPTY SPACE FOR TEXT IS. This engine
forces every shot to answer all of those (falling back to the style pack's
defaults) and refuses shots that are too vague.

camera may be omitted or "auto": the engine then assigns a shot size / lens / angle by position so neighbours differ.
composition may be omitted or "auto": a rotating text-space layout is used.

   "poses": ["idle", "talk", "blink", "walk1", "walk2", "walk3", "walk4", "point", "wow", "think", "happy"]}
  -> mira_idle (the MASTER, generated first) + one image per pose, each generated WITH mira_idle as Flow reference
     image (ELEMENTS.tsv column `ref`), same face / hair / outfit / colours / proportions, full body, facing right,
     on magenta -> `studio.py key` -> elements/cut/mira_<pose>.png -> the "character" item in EDIT.json.

kind "layer" (v3 parallax stage layer):

   "subject": "snow-capped Himalayan range with the fish-tail peak of Machapuchare", "time": "clear morning"}
  sky = full background image; every other depth = a wide seamless strip on magenta (keyed), drawn at its depth.

Output: ELEMENTS.tsv (id, name, prompt, kind, aspect_ratio) for core/flow_safe.py,
